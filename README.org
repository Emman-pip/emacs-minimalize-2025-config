* Minimal emacs config (eglot + flymake)

A minimal configuration for emacs. The creator of this config has decided to learn emacs for real (yes, including the default keybindings)...

This config will be composed of mainly eglot, flymake, other built-in libraries, and magit. A truly minimum build.
